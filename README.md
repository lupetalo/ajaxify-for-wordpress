#Ajaxify for WordPress

Most websites have the following page structure:

-Header
-Sidebar(s)
-Content
-Footer

…where only few elements vary significantly.
In the next sections you’ll find out how to load the varying elements only with this plugin,
avoiding a full page refresh and the associated full round-trip and creating awesome page load time.
When ajaxifying a site, quite a few things have to be taken into account which this plugin takes care of… So it’s an entire Ajax framework!
With Ajaxify you turn almost any standard website into a shiny new single page application (SPA) effortlessly in a few minutes.
